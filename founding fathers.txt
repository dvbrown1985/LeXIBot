The Founding Fathers of the United States, often simply referred to as the Founding Fathers or the Founders, were a group of late-18th-century American revolutionary leaders who united the Thirteen Colonies, oversaw the War of Independence from Great Britain, established the United States of America, and crafted a framework of government for the new nation.
The Founding Fathers include those who signed the United States Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, the United States Constitution and other founding documents; it can also be applied to military personnel who fought in the American Revolution. The single person most identified as "Father" of the United States is George Washington, a general in the American Revolution and the 1st President of the United States. In 1973, historian Richard B. Morris identified seven figures as key founders, based on what he called the "triple tests" of leadership, longevity, and statesmanship: John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and Washington.[2]
Most of the Founding Fathers were of English ancestry, though many had family roots extending across various regions of the British Isles, including Scotland, Wales, and Ireland. Additionally, some traced their lineage back to the early Dutch settlers of New York (New Netherland) during the colonial era, while others were descendants of French Huguenots who settled in the colonies, escaping religious persecution in France.[3][4][5]
Historical founders[edit]

Thomas Jefferson, a key Founding Father, was the primary author of the Declaration of Independence, which Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Joseph Ellis says contains "the most potent and consequential words in American history".[6]
Historian Richard Morris' selection of seven key founders was widely accepted through the 20th century.[7][8] John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin were members of the Committee of Five that were charged by the Second Continental Congress with drafting the Declaration of Independence. Franklin, Adams, and John Jay negotiated the 1783 Treaty of Paris, which established American independence and brought an end to the American Revolutionary War.[9] The constitutions drafted by Jay and Adams for their respective states of New York (1777) and Massachusetts (1780) proved influential in the language used in developing the U.S. Constitution.[10][11][12] The Federalist Papers, which advocated the ratification of the Constitution, were written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and Jay. George Washington was commander-in-chief of the Continental Army and later president of the Constitutional Convention.[13][14]
Each of these men held additional important roles in the early government of the United States. Washington, Adams, Jefferson, and Madison served as the first four presidents; Adams and Jefferson were the nation's first two vice presidents;[15] Jay was the nation's first chief justice;[16] Hamilton was the first secretary of the treasury;[17] Jefferson was the first secretary of state;[18][19] and Franklin was America's most senior diplomat from the start of the Revolutionary War through its conclusion with the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783.[20]
The list of Founding Fathers is often expanded to include the signers of the Declaration of Independence and individuals who later approved the U.S. Constitution.[2] Some scholars regard all delegates to the Constitutional Convention as Founding Fathers whether they approved the Constitution or not.[21][22] In addition, some historians include signers of the Articles of Confederation, which was adopted in 1781 as the nation's first constitution.[23]
Historians have come to recognize others as founders, such as Revolutionary War military leaders as well as participants in developments leading up to the war, including prominent writers, orators, and other men and women who contributed to cause.[8][24][25][26] Since the 19th century, the Founding Fathers have shifted from the concept of them as demigods who created the modern nation-state, to take into account their inability to address issues such as slavery and the debt owed after the American Revolutionary War.[27][28] Scholars emphasize that the Founding Fathers' accomplishments and shortcomings be viewed within the context of their time.[29]
Origin of phrase[edit]
The phrase "Founding Fathers" was first used by U.S. senator Warren G. Harding in his keynote speech at the Republican National Convention of 1916.[30] Harding later repeated the phrase at his March 4, 1921, inauguration.[31] While U.S. presidents used the terms "founders" and "fathers" in their speeches throughout much of the early 20th century, it was another 60 years before Harding's phrase would be used again during the inaugural ceremonies. Ronald Reagan referred to "Founding Fathers" at both his first inauguration on January 20, 1981, and his second on January 20, 1985.[32][33]
In 1811, responding to praise for his generation, John Adams wrote to a younger Josiah Quincy III, "I ought not to object to your Reverence for your Fathers as you call them ... but to tell you a very great secret ... I have no reason to believe We were better than you are."[34] He also wrote, "Don't call me, ... Father ... [or] Founder ... These titles belong to no man, but to the American people in general."[35]
In Thomas Jefferson's second inaugural address in 1805, he referred to those who first came to the New World as "forefathers".[36] At his 1825 inauguration, John Quincy Adams called the U.S. Constitution "the work of our forefathers" and expressed his gratitude to "founders of the Union".[37] In July of the following year, John Quincy Adams, in an executive order upon the deaths of his father John Adams and Jefferson, who died on the same day, paid tribute to them as both "Fathers" and "Founders of the Republic".[38] These terms were used in the U.S. throughout the 19th century, from the inaugurations of Martin Van Buren and James Polk in 1837 and 1845, to Abraham Lincoln's Cooper Union speech in 1860 and his Gettysburg Address in 1863, and up to William McKinley's first inauguration in 1897.[39][40][41][42]
At a 1902 celebration of Washington's Birthday in Brooklyn, James M. Beck, a constitutional lawyer and later a U.S. congressman, delivered an address, "Founders of the Republic", in which he connected the concepts of founders and fathers, saying: "It is well for us to remember certain human aspects of the founders of the republic. Let me first refer to the fact that these fathers of the republic were for the most part young men."[25]

Portraits and autograph signatures of the Founding Fathers, who signed the Declaration of Independence at the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia
The National Archives has identified three founding documents as the "Charters of Freedom": Declaration of Independence, United States Constitution, and Bill of Rights. According to the Archives, these documents "have secured the rights of the American people for nearly two and a half centuries and are considered instrumental to the founding and philosophy of the United States."[43] In addition, as the nation's first constitution, the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union is also a founding document.[44][45] As a result, signers of three key documents are generally considered to be Founding Fathers of the United States: Declaration of Independence (DI),[21] Articles of Confederation (AC),[23] and U.S. Constitution (USC).[22] The following table provides a list of these signers, some of whom signed more than one document.

Other delegates[edit]
The 55 delegates who attended the Constitutional Convention are referred to as framers. Of these, the 16 listed below did not sign the document.[46] Three refused, while the remainder left early, either in protest of the proceedings or for personal reasons.[47][48] Nevertheless, some sources regard all framers as founders, including those who did not sign:[22][49]
	•	William Richardson Davie, North Carolina
	•	Oliver Ellsworth, Connecticut
	•	Elbridge Gerry, Massachusetts *
	•	William Houston, New Jersey
	•	William Houstoun, Georgia
	•	John Lansing Jr., New York
	•	Alexander Martin, North Carolina
	•	Luther Martin, Maryland
	•	George Mason, Virginia *
	•	James McClurg, Virginia
	•	John Francis Mercer, Maryland
	•	William Pierce, Georgia
	•	Edmund Randolph, Virginia *
	•	Caleb Strong, Massachusetts
	•	George Wythe, Virginia
	•	Robert Yates, New York
(*) Randolph, Mason, and Gerry were the only three present at the Constitution's adoption who refused to sign.
Additional Founding Fathers[edit]
In addition to the signers and Framers of the founding documents and one of the seven notable leaders previously mentioned—John Jay—the following are regarded as founders based on their contributions to the creation and early development of the new nation:
	•	Elias Boudinot, New Jersey representative in the Continental Congress, Congress of the Confederation (president 1782–1783), and the first three U.S. Congresses. Boudinot was director of the U.S. Mint under presidents Washington, Adams, and Jefferson, and also was the founding president of the American Bible Society.[50]
	•	Aaron Burr, vice president under Jefferson[51]
	•	George Clinton, first governor of New York, 1777–1795, served again from 1801 to 1805, and was the fourth vice president of the US, 1805–1812. He was an anti-Federalist advocate of the Bill of Rights.[52]
	•	Patrick Henry, gifted orator, known for his famous quote, "Give me liberty or give me death!",[53] served in the First Continental Congress in 1774 and briefly in the Second Congress in 1775 before returning to Virginia to lead its militia. He then completed terms as the first and sixth governor of Virginia, 1776–1779 and 1784–1786.[54]
	•	Esek Hopkins, commander-in-chief of the Continental Navy[55]
	•	Henry Knox served as chief artillery officer in most of Washington's campaigns. His earliest achievement was the capture of over 50 pieces of artillery, primarily cannons, at New York's Fort Ticonderoga, one of the keys to Washington's capture of Boston in early 1776. Knox became the first secretary of war under the U.S. Constitution in 1789.[25]
	•	Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, French Marquis who became a Continental Army general.[56] Served without pay, brought a ship to America, outfitted for war, provided clothing and other provisions for the patriot cause, all at his own expense.[57]
	•	Arthur Lee, diplomat who helped negotiate and signed the 1778 Treaty of Alliance with France, along with Benjamin Franklin and Silas Deane.
	•	Robert R. Livingston, member of the Committee of Five that drafted the Declaration of Independence, 1776; first U.S. secretary of foreign affairs, 1781–1783, and first chancellor of New York, 1777–1801. He administered the presidential oath of office at the first inauguration of George Washington and with James Monroe negotiated the Louisiana Purchase as the minister to France.[58][59]
	•	John Marshall served with George Washington at Valley Forge and later would be the first to refer to him as "the Father of his country". Appointed the fourth chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court under John Adams, Marshall defined the authority of the court and ensured the stability of the federal government during the first three decades of the 19th century.[60][61][62][63]
	•	James Monroe, elected to the Virginia legislature (1782); member of the Continental Congress (1783–1786);[64] fifth president of the United States for two terms (1817–1825);[65] Negotiated the Louisiana Purchase along with Robert Livingston.[66]
	•	James Otis Jr., pamphleteer, one of the earliest proponents of patriotic causes, an opponent of slavery, and leader of Massachusetts' Committee of Correspondence, all in the 1760s.[67][68]
	•	Thomas Paine, author of Common Sense and other influential pamphlets in the 1770s; sometimes referred to as "Father of the American Revolution".[60][69][70] While John Adams strongly criticized Paine for failing to see the need for a separation of powers in government, Common Sense proved crucial in building support for independence following its publication in January 1776.[71][72]
	•	Timothy Pickering, Secretary of War, U.S. secretary of state, from Massachusetts. Fired by President John Adams; replaced by John Marshall.[73]
	•	Thomas Pinckney, signer of the Pinckney's Treaty with Spain, fought as an officer in the Continental Army and served as a United States ambassador to Great Britain
	•	Peyton Randolph, speaker of Virginia's House of Burgesses, president of the First Continental Congress, and a signer of the Continental Association.[74]
	•	John Rogers, Maryland lawyer and judge, delegate to the Continental Congress who voted for the Declaration of Independence but fell ill before he could sign it.[75]
	•	Charles Thomson, secretary of the Continental Congress from its formation to its final session, 1774–1789.[76]
	•	Joseph Warren, respected physician and architect of the Revolutionary movement, known as the "Founding Martyr" for his death at the Battle of Bunker Hill, drafted the Suffolk Resolves in response to the Intolerable Acts.[77]
	•	"Mad Anthony" Wayne, a prominent army general during the Revolutionary War.[60][78]
	•	Thomas Willing, delegate to the Continental Congress from Pennsylvania, the first president of the Bank of North America, and the first president of the First Bank of the United States[79]
	•	Henry Wisner, New York Continental Congress delegate who voted for the Declaration of Independence but left Philadelphia before the signing.
